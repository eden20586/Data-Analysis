# Data-Analysis
Hey, I'm Eden Admoni, and in this repository, I will show some projects in Data-Analysis.

In the projects, we will see the ability to write codes, Analysis the data in the df, create graphs, and more.

The first project is smaller and more basic than the second project, Both projects wrote in Python.

The course was in the academy within B.A in information systems.
